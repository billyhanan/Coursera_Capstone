# Coursera_Capstone (Dec 2020)
The contents found within this directory is the work performed for my Capstone Project while studing for the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" on Coursera. The project involved the collection of restaurant data from European cities using the Foursquare API. Clustering and regression analysis was subsequently performed on this data in order to investigate if there was any correlation between the level of multiculturalism in a city and the variety of cuisine types available in its restaurants.
